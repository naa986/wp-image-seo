WordPress Image SEO plugin allows you to improve the structures of your site images and make them more search engine friendly.

== Description ==

WordPress has a nice media library option in which you can upload images very easily. While uploading images most of us just totally ignore the alt tags. Alt tag is an important part of your image. It describes what your image is about. 

When you publish a post/page you can directly view the image. The image might be understandable to you when you take a look at it. But for the crawler it's not. The crawler does not understand the image. It reads the alt tag and tries to understand the image. So if your alt tag is empty or not relevant to your topic it's pretty much useless in search engine.

[WP Image SEO](https://noorsplugin.com/wordpress-image-seo-plugin/) allows you to optimize your blog images. It automatically fills out the missing alt tags of your images.

= WordPress Image SEO Plugin Features =

* Optimize your WordPress blog images for SEO.
* Change the alt and title tags of your images automatically.
* Improve search engine ranking by using more meaningful alt tags.
* Efficiently manage the alt tags of all of your post images.

= WordPress Image SEO Plugin Usage =

Once you have installed the plugin go to **Settings->WP Image SEO** on your WP dashboard. It will take you to the **General Settings** menu of the plugin

In the **General Settings** menu there are various options that you can configure.

* ALT attribute - It allows you to change the alt attributes
* TITLE attribute - It allows you to change the title attributes

You can either directly enter a text for the ALT and TITLE attributes or use the following tags:

* %name - It allows you to automatically replace the alt or title tag with the name of the image
* %title - It allows you to automatically replace the alt or title tag with the title of the current post

You need to enable the following options to change the alt and title attributes automatically:

* Override default WordPress image alt tag
* Override default WordPress image title

= Example =

If you have an image named "McLaren.jpg" in a post titled "Car Image": 

1. Setting alt attribute to "%name %title" will produce alt="McLaren Car Image"
1. Setting title attribute to "%name image" will produce title="McLaren image"
